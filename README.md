# Frida MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for Frida dynamic instrumentation toolkit.

## Overview

This package provides an MCP-compliant server for Frida, enabling AI systems to interact with mobile and desktop applications through Frida's dynamic instrumentation capabilities. It uses the official [MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) to enable seamless integration with AI applications.

   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the following to your configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "frida": {
      "command": "frida-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
